Introduction to Pandas.

Pandas works hand-in-hand with other python libraries (e.g. matplotlib and numpy) to make manipulating data (what the Pandas team calls "Data Munging") easy. With pandas it is easy to:

1. Easily access data using variable names, but have full linear algebra capabilities of numpy
2. Group data by values (for example, calculate the mean income by state)
3. Plot and summarize values
4. Join (combine) different sources of data
5. Powerful time series and panel data capabilities (beyond scope of course)
